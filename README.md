## Cognition of open-source ##
The video on the list Enhanced my understanding of open source software. Actually, I have been using the 3d open-source software called blender which bring me a really nice experience.I think open source would be a trend in the future. As Society Centered Design claimed ，equity Is a very important standard of designing a products or service.  Open source software 
is free and available for all the users, especially for some freshman in the industry who can’t afford the expensive price charged from software, that would be a really good choice to get start.


- Blender community allows all the users to code the plug-in and share with each other.
- If you want to start 3D Creation and experience using open source software, I highly recommend you to download blender.

## Learning process on tinkerCAD ##
This is the part that I struggle with.I learned some knowledges from Physics class in my high school, but now I basically forget them all. I start learning on the simulation website and I found it was really hard to deeply understand the logic behind the circuit, while the tutorial on the website helped me a lot. They used a simplify model to illustrate how did circuit work (figure below). Finally I lit the bulbs in series circuit, parallel circuit and simple circuit respectively.
