# Day1 #
## Cognition of open-source ##
The video on the list Enhanced my understanding of open source software. Actually, I have been using the 3d open-source software called blender which bring me a really nice experience.I think open source would be a trend in the future. As Society Centered Design claimed ，equity Is a very important standard of designing a products or service.  Open source software 
is free and available for all the users, especially for some freshman in the industry who can’t afford the expensive price charged from software, that would be a really good choice to get start.


- Blender community allows all the users to code the plug-in and share with each other.
- If you want to start 3D Creation and experience using open source software, I highly recommend you to download blender.

## Learning process on tinkerCAD ##
This is the part that I struggle with.I learned some knowledges from Physics class in my high school, but now I basically forget them all. I start learning on the simulation website and I found it was really hard to deeply understand the logic behind the circuit, while the tutorial on the website helped me a lot. They used a simplify model to illustrate how did circuit work (figure below). Finally I lit the bulbs in series circuit, parallel circuit and simple circuit respectively.

### Project 1 ASCII ART ###

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general. ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages. Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation.

process
- You will be typing in the character you will use.

- Then your computer will arrange their grayscale in order.

- The more pixels a character has, the greater its grayscale.
- Then, run it and upload the photo, you will get a ASCII art.





### Project 2 name tag based on the arduino ###
- As a freshman in computing art, I decided to record my engagement of open-source community in a digital
way. I was inspired by name tag sticker ,then I  roughly structured my Idea, a digital name tag with LCD based on Arduino.

- Then I roughly build my idea in the 3D software

# Reflection #

Although my project 1 didn't run successfully, it was a good attempt. I've been looking forward to be a digital artist. Once I only used node models in Blender and Touchdesigner to create some generative Art. Now the coding expands my creative thinking. I think the exploration of open source community and computing art is our mission in this era. I think artists' works should be based on the times. We are playing the character like Van Gogh and Da Vinci in the digital age. As pioneers, we have the obligation to contribute the community with digital art. On the other hand, I am a supporter of the open source community. I don't like the business model of adobe and Autodesk. I hope more open source software can join the community in the future to resist the unfair distribution of capitalists and society. At the same time, I also hope that I can make some contributions to the open source community in the future.
